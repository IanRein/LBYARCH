# LBYARCH
LBYARCH final project
Shown in the video I will post is a 3*4 just like the one in the specs
Also shown in the video will be an expected output and simulated with 100 values between 1.00 and 0.00 from CHATGPT
The code itself is uploaded in chatgpt ONLY not used to generate the code
In the video one can see that its not a 100% correct truncating of the values the explanation is below:
1. Integer processing can sometimes be different between programs like python, 0.39 is not necessarily JUST 0.39 but also has more values but only cut short in the output
2. Example of this is when one multiplies 0.39 * 255 = 99.45, in computer computing(python specifically) round(99.45) is 99 and not 100
3. All in all the differences are just due to rounding and floating-point representation.
Files uploaded in this github:
1. Screenshots of the specs
2. Videos of testing
3. Test Case code running with Averaged Run Time
4. Full Code .c(main.c) and asm (folder used in visual studio too) + Test Case Run Time code used as a seperate .c(RunTime.c) File copy pasted over the main.c file when wanting to check the runtime of the code with a few changes to reflect the test cases
5. Screenshots
